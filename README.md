# macOS

Do you know every little hack to get around the growing pains of SwiftUI? In this event you will have to get creative! Show off your favorite SwiftUI workaround in a simple project. Explain why your workaround is necessary, and (optionally) compare it to UIKit/AppKit. If you want to record a little video that would be even better!

- Show the world your favorite SwiftUI Workaround
- Browse through your previous SwiftUI projects and find your favorite funky hack that you're proud off!
- Examples could be: popping a view stack back to root, customising Lists, custom Navigation Bars and TextFields, map overlays, image carousels, complex navigation, observing the scroll position in ScrollViews, caching images etc etc!
- In text or a video explain the challenge you were trying to solve, and optionally show how you would have done it in UIKit/AppKit
- Upload your code to a public GitHub repo and add it to this repo in a PR
